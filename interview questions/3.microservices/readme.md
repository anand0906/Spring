## Microservices Fundamentals

### Q1: What is microservices architecture?
**Answer:** Microservices architecture enables large teams to build scalable applications that are composed of many loosely coupled services. Each microservice:
- Has its own database
- Is developed independently
- Is deployed independently
- Is scaled independently
- Exposes REST APIs
- Is loosely coupled with other services

### Q2: What are the key characteristics of microservices?
**Answer:**
- **Independent Development**: Each microservice can be developed by different teams
- **Independent Deployment**: Services can be deployed without affecting others
- **Independent Scaling**: Scale services based on individual requirements
- **Database per Service**: Each service manages its own data
- **Loose Coupling**: Services interact through well-defined APIs
- **Technology Diversity**: Different services can use different technologies

### Q3: How do microservices communicate with each other?
**Answer:** There are two types of communication styles:

**Synchronous Communication:**
- Uses HTTP protocol
- One service makes REST API calls to another service
- Direct request-response pattern

**Asynchronous Communication:**
- Uses message brokers (like RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka)
- Services communicate through events/messages
- Publisher-subscriber pattern

### Q4: What are the key components in microservices architecture?
**Answer:**
- **API Gateway**: Routes client requests to appropriate microservices
- **Service Registry**: Maintains registry of all microservices and their instances
- **Config Server**: Externalizes configuration of microservices
- **Distributed Tracing**: Maintains logs and trace hierarchy of HTTP calls
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes requests across service instances
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascade failures

## API Gateway

### Q8: What is API Gateway and why is it important?
**Answer:** API Gateway sits between clients and backend microservices. It's important because:
- **Unified Interface**: Clients don't need to know details of individual microservices
- **Routing**: Routes requests to appropriate microservices based on rules
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes requests across multiple service instances
- **Centralized Security**: Implements authentication/authorization in one place
- **Cross-cutting Concerns**: Handles monitoring, rate limiting, etc.

### Q9: What problems does API Gateway solve?
**Answer:**
- **Multiple Service Calls**: Client doesn't need to remember hostnames/ports of all services
- **Tight Coupling**: Reduces coupling between client and multiple microservices
- **Security**: Centralized authentication instead of each service handling security
- **Load Balancing**: Automatically distributes load across service instances

### Q10: How to implement API Gateway in Spring Boot?
**Answer:** Use Spring Cloud Gateway library:
- Add Spring Cloud Gateway dependency
- Configure routing rules in application.yml
- Implement custom filters for cross-cutting concerns
- Configure load balancing and service discovery integration

## Service Registry & Discovery

### Q11: Why is Service Registry and Discovery important?
**Answer:** In microservices projects:
- We run multiple instances of services for scaling
- Service instances may come up and go down anytime in cloud environments
- We need automatic service registration and discovery mechanism
- Avoids hard-coding hostnames and port numbers

### Q12: What problems does Service Registry solve?
**Answer:**
- **Hard-coded Configuration**: Services don't need to know exact hostnames/ports of other services
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatically handles new instances of services
- **Service Tracking**: Keeps track of which services are up/down
- **Load Balancing**: Provides load-balanced URLs for service communication

### Q13: How does Service Discovery work?
**Answer:**
1. All microservices register themselves with Service Registry
2. When Service A wants to call Service B, it queries Service Registry
3. Service Registry returns available instances of Service B
4. Service A uses load-balanced URL to call Service B
5. No need to hard-code hostnames and ports

### Q14: How to implement Service Registry in Spring Boot?
**Answer:** Use Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka:
- Create Eureka Server with `@EnableEurekaServer`
- Register services as Eureka clients with `@EnableEurekaClient`
- Configure eureka server URL in client applications
- Use service names instead of hard-coded URLs

## Configuration Management

### Q15: What problems does Config Server solve?
**Answer:**
1. **Restart Issue**: Without config server, changing configuration requires service restart
2. **Centralized Management**: Externalizes all configuration files to a central repository (like Git)
3. **Easy Updates**: Change configuration in central place without touching individual services

### Q16: What are the advantages of Spring Cloud Config Server?
**Answer:**
- **No Restart Required**: Configuration changes don't require service restart
- **Centralized Configuration**: All config files stored in central repository
- **Version Control**: Configuration changes can be tracked in Git
- **Environment Specific**: Different configurations for different environments
- **Dynamic Refresh**: Services can refresh configuration at runtime

### Q17: How does Config Server work?
**Answer:**
1. Create Config Server application with `@EnableConfigServer`
2. Configure Git repository URL containing configuration files
3. Client services connect to Config Server to fetch their configuration
4. Configuration files are named as `{service-name}-{profile}.yml`
5. Services can refresh configuration using `/actuator/refresh` endpoint

## Distributed Tracing

### Q18: What is Distributed Tracing and why is it needed?
**Answer:** Distributed tracing is the ability to trace a request across multiple microservices. It's needed because:
- User requests span multiple microservices
- Difficult to debug issues when many services are involved
- Need to trace the complete request flow from start to end
- Identify which service is causing performance issues

### Q19: What problems does Distributed Tracing solve?
**Answer:**
- **Request Tracing**: Track complete request flow across multiple services
- **Performance Monitoring**: Identify which service is taking too much time
- **Error Debugging**: Quickly identify where in the chain an error occurred
- **Dependency Mapping**: Understand service dependencies and call patterns

### Q20: How to implement Distributed Tracing?
**Answer:** Use Spring Cloud Sleuth with Zipkin:
- Add Spring Cloud Sleuth dependency
- Configure Zipkin server for visualization
- Sleuth automatically adds trace IDs to logs
- Zipkin provides UI to visualize trace information
- Each request gets unique trace ID across all services

## Event-Driven Architecture

### Q21: What is Event-Driven Architecture?
**Answer:** Event-driven architecture is a software design pattern where decoupled applications communicate asynchronously through events via message brokers. Applications publish and subscribe to events without knowing about each other.

### Q22: What are the characteristics of Event-Driven Architecture?
**Answer:**
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Publishers don't wait for response
- **Loose Coupling**: Publishers don't know about subscribers
- **Language Agnostic**: Can be implemented in any programming language
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new consumers without affecting producers
- **Resilient**: If one service is down, others continue working

### Q23: What are the advantages of Event-Driven Microservices?
**Answer:**
- **Flexibility and Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new microservices as event consumers
- **Availability**: If one service goes down, others remain unaffected
- **Loose Coupling**: Services are independent of each other
- **Real-time Processing**: Events can be processed as they occur

### Q24: How does Event-Driven Microservices work?
**Answer:**
1. Producer service creates an event (e.g., order created)
2. Event is published to message broker (RabbitMQ, Kafka)
3. Consumer services subscribe to relevant events
4. When event is published, all subscribers receive it
5. Each consumer processes the event independently
6. No direct communication between producer and consumers

## Circuit Breaker Pattern

### Q25: What problem does Circuit Breaker pattern solve?
**Answer:** In microservices, services are dependent on each other. If one service fails or becomes slow, it can cause cascade failures throughout the entire chain. Circuit breaker prevents continuous calls to failing services and provides fallback responses.

### Q26: How does Circuit Breaker work?
**Answer:** Circuit breaker has three states:
- **Closed**: Normal operation, requests flow through
- **Open**: Service is failing, requests are blocked and fallback response is returned
- **Half-Open**: Periodically allows requests to test if service has recovered

### Q27: What are the benefits of Circuit Breaker pattern?
**Answer:**
- **Prevents Cascade Failures**: Stops failure propagation across services
- **Resource Conservation**: Avoids wasting resources on failing calls
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Provides default responses when services are down
- **Automatic Recovery**: Automatically detects when service is back up
- **Improved User Experience**: Users get immediate fallback response instead of waiting

### Q28: What other resilience patterns work with Circuit Breaker?
**Answer:**
- **Retry Pattern**: Retry failed requests with exponential backoff
- **Timeout Pattern**: Set timeouts for service calls
- **Bulkhead Pattern**: Isolate resources to prevent total system failure
- **Rate Limiting**: Limit number of requests to protect services
- **Fallback Pattern**: Provide alternative response when primary service fails
